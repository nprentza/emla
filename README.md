**Explainable Machine Learning via Argumentation (EMLA)**

This repo will host a generalized version of [ArgEML](https://github.com/nicolepr/argeml), 
a general Explainable Machine Learning Framework and Methodology based on Argumentation. 
More information can be found in the paper [Explainable Machine Learning via Argumentation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44070-0_19).

At the moment, the repo includes the `oner` library that learns single condition rules from a given dataset using the concepts of 
"One Rule" classification algorithm [OneR](https://www.saedsayad.com/oner.htm).
